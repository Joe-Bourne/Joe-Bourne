### About Me
Professional software developer based in the UK with many years of experience gained mostly from building srategic and RAD front office systems financial asset mananagement companies and hedgefunds. 

I work mainly with C#, SQL Server, and VBA - often extending and integrating with Excel to support trading and operations teams.

Outside of work, I like to experiment with new technologies and build applications for fun or to scratch an itch. I'm particularly interested in:

Cloudflare Workers & serverless development

.NET MAUI for cross-platform mobile apps

Excel-DNA for extending Excel with C#

SQLite for lightweight local data storage

Clean, pragmatic code that solves real problems

Sadly, most of the interesting things I build professionally stay behind closed doors â€” so what you see here is a collection of my personal projects, prototypes, and experiments.

Still learning. Always building. Sharing what I can.
