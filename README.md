### 🛠️ What I’m Into

Outside of work, I love experimenting with new technologies and building apps just for fun (or to scratch a technical itch). I'm especially interested in:

- ☁️ **Cloudflare Workers** & serverless development
- 📱 **.NET MAUI** for cross-platform mobile apps
- 🧩 **Excel-DNA** for extending Excel with C#
- 🗃️ **SQLite** for lightweight local data storage
- 🧼 Clean, pragmatic code that solves real problems

### 🔒 What You’ll Find Here

Sadly, most of my work is behind closed doors — but this GitHub is where I share:

- ✨ Personal projects
- 🧪 Prototypes
- 🧠 Experiments
- 💡 Little tools that make life easier

> Still learning. Always building. Sharing what I can.
